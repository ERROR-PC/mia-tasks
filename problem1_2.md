Power = I^2 * R or I * V

the resistor + lamp are connected in series -> same current = 0.1A

1440 = [(power of resistor) + (power of lamp)] * count of branches

1440 = [(0.1^2 * 330) + (0.1 * 2)] * count

count = 2880 / 7 ~= 411.43 branches

count of branches is the same as count of LEDs; each branch has one LED and a resistor.

count of LEDs = 411 (round down)
